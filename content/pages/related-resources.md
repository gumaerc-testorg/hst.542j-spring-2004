Cardiovascular Simulator ({{% resource_link ca97693e-23fa-a23d-5fe5-b5787438e2bb "PDF" %}})
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Cardiovascular Simulator is a dynamic computer simulation of human cardiovascular hemodynamics, primarily intended for students of physiology and medicine. It is implemented on engineering workstations running the X Window System, allowing the student to perform a variety of measurements in a real-time simulated cardiovascular system, not all of which would be possible in an animal laboratory. The simulation is based on the lumped-parameter mathematical model taught in Quantitative Physiology and Cardiovascular Pathophysiology courses in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. The computer simulation is implemented on the MIT Project Athena student computing network.
